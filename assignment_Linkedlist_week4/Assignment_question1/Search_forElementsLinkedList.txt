    Commence the search operation by positioning a pointer at the beginning of the linked list, starting from the head.
    Traverse through the linked list using a loop, advancing node by node, until either discovering the target element or reaching the list's termination.
    Examine each node during traversal, comparing its stored value with the target element being sought.
    Persist in this process until either locating the target element or exhausting all nodes in the list.
    Handle the scenario where the end of the list is reached without finding the target element, signifying its absence.
    Depending on the search outcome, return either the node containing the target element (if found) or an indication that the element is absent in the list.
    Cease the search algorithm upon finding the target element or reaching the end of the list.

This iterative strategy meticulously inspects each node within the linked list until either locating the target element or concluding the search at the list's termination, rendering it a methodical and dependable approach for linked list searches.
